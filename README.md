# Edge-Detection-ML
Edge detection using traditional methods (Canny, Sobel) and deep learning (U-Net, HED). Machine learning for computer vision.

##   Overview

This project implements and compares traditional and deep learning-based edge detection methods. It uses OpenCV for traditional methods (Canny and Sobel) and a pre-trained HED model for deep learning-based edge detection.

##   Project Structure

The project contains two main components, each implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Traditional Edge Detection:**
    * Implements the Canny Edge Detector and Sobel Filter.
    * Applies these algorithms to sample images.
    * Visualizes and compares the results using plots.
2.  **Deep Learning-Based Edge Detection:**
    * Utilizes a pre-trained HED model.
    * Generates edge predictions.
    * Compares the deep learning results with the traditional methods using plots.

##   Methodology

###   1.  Dataset Preparation

* The BSDS500 dataset (or an alternative suitable dataset) was used. [cite: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
* This dataset provides images and, potentially, ground truth edge maps, which are essential for training and evaluating edge detection models.
* The dataset was likely preprocessed, which might include resizing, normalization, or other image enhancements to ensure compatibility with the models.

###   2.  Traditional Edge Detection Implementation

* **Canny Edge Detection:**
    * OpenCV's Canny Edge Detector was implemented. [cite: 13]
    * This involved applying the Canny algorithm to sample images from the dataset.
    * The Canny algorithm involves several steps:
        * Noise reduction (e.g., using a Gaussian filter).
        * Finding intensity gradients of the image.
        * Applying non-maximum suppression to thin out edges.
        * Hysteresis thresholding to determine which edges are actual edges and which are noise.
* **Sobel Filter:**
    * OpenCV's Sobel operator was implemented. [cite: 13]
    * This involved applying the Sobel kernels to sample images to calculate gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions.
    * The magnitude of the gradient is then used to identify edges.
* **Visualization:**
    * The results of both Canny and Sobel edge detection were visualized. [cite: 13, 14]
    * This likely involved displaying the original images alongside their corresponding edge maps generated by each method.

###   3.  Deep Learning-Based Edge Detection

* **Model Selection:**
    * A pre-trained HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) model was chosen. [cite: 16]
    * The HED model is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for edge detection. [cite: 16]
* **Edge Prediction:**
    * The pre-trained HED model was used to generate edge predictions on sample images from the dataset. [cite: 16, 17]
    * This involved feeding the images through the model and obtaining the model's output, which represents the predicted edge map.

###   4.  Results and Comparison

* **Visualization:**
    * The edge detection results from both traditional methods (Canny and Sobel) and the deep learning method (HED) were visualized.
    * This allowed for a qualitative comparison of the different methods.
* **Analysis:**
    * The results were analyzed to compare the performance of each edge detection method. [cite: 17]
    * This analysis likely considered factors such as:
        * Accuracy of edge detection.
        * Ability to detect fine details.
        * Noise sensitivity.
        * Computational efficiency.
* **Plotting:** The results were plotted to provide a clear visual representation for comparison.

##   Results

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of the pre-trained HED model in producing more refined and accurate edge maps compared to the traditional Canny and Sobel methods. The deep learning approach captures complex edge structures and is less sensitive to noise. Results are presented and compared using visual plots.

##   Analysis

* Traditional methods are computationally efficient but may produce noisy or broken edges.
* The deep learning model provides superior edge detection accuracy but requires more computational resources.
* Plots generated from the results provide a clear visual representation of these differences.

##   Conclusion

This project successfully implements and compares traditional and deep learning-based edge detection techniques. The results, including visual plots, indicate that deep learning-based methods, particularly the pre-trained HED model, outperform traditional methods in terms of edge detection accuracy and robustness.
